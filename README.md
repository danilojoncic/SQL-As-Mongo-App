# SQL-As-Mongo-App
a simple Java Swing app that allows the user to input SQL queries as input into the text field, and for those queries to be translated as objects and finally into mongodb accepted queries and the output to be presented back into the table in the lower part of the gui

Text input -> SQL Object creation -> SQL Object validation -> Adaptation using .jsonify -> Sending docs -> Recieving docs -> Formating into table
